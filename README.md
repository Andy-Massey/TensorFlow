# What's new in TensorFlow 2.0

So you might think, so what? Just some imports change. But this is only one part of the story. Yes, the imports changed, and as you can see later in the example, you can basically leave your existing Keras code intact most of the times and just change the import and you are done.

But in addition, Keras now can make use of built-in TensorFlow functionality which wasn't possible before. For example, you can take your 1:1 Keras code and TensorFlow will scale it to a large GPU or TPU cluster. We'll have a look at this in the next chapter.

For now, just follow along the video and code exercise below to get an idea how things work:

### Tasks

1. [Watch me coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4mJZQdgV0Y)


2. [Code yourself](https://github.com/romeokienzler/TensorFlow/blob/master/notebooks/tf2.keras.ipynb) 





This material is constantly updated for you, so stay tuned! ... (e.g. this means that the rest of the chapters are currently be written :D
